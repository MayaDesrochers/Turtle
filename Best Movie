The best movie that I saw this summer was Joker. Joker is a very interesting, creepy and at times gory movie. The movie follows a man who works as a clown, who dreams of becoming a comedian. However, he has a lot of trouble because he has Pseudobulbar affect, a dissorder where he laughs uncontrollably. He faces a lot of hate for this. At one point, he ends up killing three men on the subway. During the act he was wearing his clown costume. The hunt for the murderer gained mixed views, those who feel he should be arrested and those who did not. The clown, Joker, ultimately is seen as a hero by the rioters.
